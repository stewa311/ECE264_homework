Failed attemp at hw 17

This is an attemp at creating a huffman compression tree instead of decoding one

There is still a missing step
That is it still needs to make the frequency table of characters and use those as the input to the step that creates the huffman tree

The 2 completed steps are creating a string from the input file and the last step that takes the frequency table values and creates the key from them.
